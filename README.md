## Gameplay Overview

- You control a player equipped with ranged weapons.
- Enemies spawn endlessly and attack using projectiles.
- Health bars for both player and enemies.
- The game ends when the player dies. Restart automatically.
- Enemy AI uses NavMesh for smart pathfinding.
- Objective: Get the **highest kill count** before dying.

## Features

- Endless enemy wave spawner (10 enemies max at a time)
- Kill counter with UI
- Player & enemy health systems with dynamic health bars
- Enemy projectile system with muzzle flash
- Object pooling for enemies (performance optimized)
- Main menu, pause menu, and game over screen *(optional addition)*

## Key Concepts & Math

- **NavMesh Navigation**: Enemy movement using Unityâ€™s AI pathfinding.
- **Vector3 Math**: Used for rotation, distance checking, and projectile trajectory.
- **Coroutines**: For timing-based spawning and restarts.
- **Health Calculation**: `currentHealth -= damage`, clamped and visualized with sliders.
